# AsyncJSTalk
The Future of Async JavaScript

This was an interactive presentation given for GDG Nothern Colorado on May 20th, 2015.

I ran the contents of this archive in a local webserver on my laptop.

Each attendee brought up the "index.html" file from this archive from my laptop's server in the browser of their choice. This gave them the slides of my presentation, a browser-based development envirionment where they could try the exercises and a list of documentation and resources.

I then gave a series of very brief talks, followed by a suggested exercise.


There was then a talk summary and general discussion.
